# weather-man

## Description

The intent of this project is to have a weather app to check the climate of various cities.

The user can search common cities which presents the current and five day forecast.

I learned from this project to remember to clear local storage as it may crash the app on a fresh start-up after coding was thought to be done.

I was more pragmatic on this challenge regarding dynamic content.  Much was just designed at the outset to be static in HTML and that worked out fine.

Please note that I deliberately capped the history to fifteen entries.
